    "## Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical applications, although the data reside in a high-dimensional space, the true dimensionality, known as intrinsic dimensionality, can be of a much lower value.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, in a three-dimensional space, the data may cluster around a straight line, or around the circumference of a circle or the graph of a parabola, arbitrarily placed in R^3. In all previous cases, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is equal to one, as any of these curves can equivalently\n",
    "be described in terms of a single parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below figure illustrates the three cases. Learning the lower-dimensional structure associated with a given set of data is gaining in importance in the context of big data processing and analysis. Some typical examples are the disciplines of computer vision, robotics, medical imaging, and computational neuroscience.\n",

    "The data reside close to (A) a straight line, (B) the circumference of a circle, and (C) the graph of a parabola in the three-dimensional space. In all three cases, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is equal to one. In (A) the data are clustered around a (translated/affine) linear subspace and in (B) and (C) around one-dimensional manifolds.\n",

    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",

    "Dimensionality reduction may be both linear or non-linear, depending upon the method used. The prime linear method, called Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA) or Karhunen–Loève transform is among the oldest and most widely used methods for dimensionality reduction [105]. The assumption underlying PCA, as well as any dimensionality reduction technique, is that the observed data are generated by a system or process that is driven by a (relatively) small number of latent (not directly observed) variables. The goal is to learn this latent structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. Here is what Wikipedia says about PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Given a collection of points in two, three, or higher dimensional space, a “best fitting” line can be defined as one that minimizes the average squared distance from a point to the line. The next best-fitting line can be similarly chosen from directions perpendicular to the first. Repeating this process yields an orthogonal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated. These basis vectors are called principal components, and several related procedures principal component analysis (PCA).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, PCA means extracting the components (features) which are most effective in forecasting the target variable in a dataset, and discarding the redundant features. Thus, we calculate the Principal Components to achieve Dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no best technique for dimensionality reduction and no mapping of techniques to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the best approach is to use systematic controlled experiments to discover what dimensionality reduction techniques, when paired with your model of choice, result in the best performance on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, linear algebra and manifold learning methods assume that all input features have the same scale or distribution. This suggests that it is good practice to either normalize or standardize data prior to using these methods if the input variables have differing scales or units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When should I use Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of PCA as an exploratory technique to investigate and study your system before doing other things. Dimensionality reduction, by nature, loses some information, just like image compression for instance. Consequently, it will often reduce the prediction quality of your model, but depending on the data it could also leave it unchanged or even improve it in some cases (very noisy data). In general, its main benefit will be to speed up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides speed of training, feature reduction also help with multicollinearity in some cases. Which is mainly an issue if you are interested in parameters estimation, like in causal analysis. For instance, if you use a multiple linear regression model to estimate the effect of some regressors on a dependent variable, multicollinearity will prevent proper parameters estimation because you won't be able to identify the effect of each regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many other ML applications, we don't really care about parameters identification, we care about how a set of variables can be used to predict another variable. If some variables are highly correlated, then there will be some redundant information in your data, but this shouldn't be problematic in terms of prediction quality."
