    "\n",
    "A sequential model, which is a linear stack of layers as the name suggests, allows you to create models layer-by-layer in a step-by-step fashion. Keras Sequential API is by far the easiest way to get up and running with Keras, but it’s also the most limited — you cannot create models that:\n",

    "Share layers\n",
    "Have branches (at least not easily)\n",
    "Have multiple inputs\n",
    "Have multiple outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The model needs to know what input shape it should expect. For this reason, the first layer in a sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the example above, this is done by passing an input_shape argument to the first layer. This is a list of integers or NULL entries, where NULL indicates that any positive integer may be expected. In input_shape, the batch dimension is not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever need to specify a fixed batch size for your inputs (this is useful for stateful recurrent networks), you can pass a batch_size argument to a layer. If you pass both batch_size=32 and input_shape=c(6, 8) to a layer, it will then expect every batch of inputs to have the batch shape (32, 6, 8).\n",

    "### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ReLU is the most used activation function in the world right now.Since, it is used in almost all the convolutional neural networks or deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The ReLU function is f(x)=max(0,x).\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/2ezpnE3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the ReLU is half rectified (from bottom). f(z) is zero when z is less than zero and f(z) is equal to z when z is above or equal to zero.\n",
    "Range: [ 0 to infinity)\n",
    "The function and its derivative both are monotonic.\n",
    "But the issue is that all the negative values become zero immediately which decreases the ability of the model to fit or train from the data properly. That means any negative input given to the ReLU activation function turns the value into zero immediately in the graph, which in turns affects the resulting graph by not mapping the negative values appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way ReLUs improve neural networks is by speeding up training. The gradient computation is very simple (either 0 or 1 depending on the sign of x). Also, the computational step of a ReLU is easy: any negative elements are set to 0.0 -- no exponentials, no multiplication or division operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients of logistic and hyperbolic tangent networks are smaller than the positive portion of the ReLU. This means that the positive portion is updated more rapidly as training progresses. However, this comes at a cost. The 0 gradient on the left-hand side is has its own problem, called \"dead neurons,\" in which a gradient update sets the incoming values to a ReLU such that the output is always zero; modified ReLU units such as ELU (or Leaky ReLU, or PReLU, etc.) can ameliorate this.\n",

    "The layer will transform inputs so that they are standardized, meaning that they will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the layer will keep track of statistics for each input variable and use them to standardize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the standardized output can be scaled using the learned parameters of Beta and Gamma that define the new mean and standard deviation for the output of the transform. The layer can be configured to control whether these additional parameters will be used or not via the “center” and “scale” attributes respectively. By default, they are enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics used to perform the standardization, e.g. the mean and standard deviation of each variable, are updated for each mini batch and a running average is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "A “momentum” argument allows you to control how much of the statistics from the previous mini batch to include when the update is calculated. By default, this is kept high with a value of 0.99. This can be set to 0.0 to only use statistics from the current mini-batch, as described in the original paper."
