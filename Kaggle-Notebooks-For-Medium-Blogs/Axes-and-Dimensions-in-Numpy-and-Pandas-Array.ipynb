    "\n",
    "In _Mathematics/Physics_, dimension or dimensionality is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within a space. But in _Numpy_, according to the [**numpy doc**](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html#the-basics), it’s the same as axis/axes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_In Numpy dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank._**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most simple terms, when you have more than 1-dimensional array than the concept of the Axis is comes at all. For example, the 2-D array has 2 Axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first axis ( i.e. axis-0 ) is running vertically downwards across rows, and the second (axis-1) running horizontally across columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fr4sfcnDc0KsXA8P.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What may make more sense from a pure programming perspective of action on array elements :**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Axis 0 will act on all the ROWS in each COLUMN\n",
    "\n",
    "> Axis 1 will act on all the COLUMNS in each ROW\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basically simplest to remember it as _0=down_ and _1=across_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So a** `**mean**` **calculation on axis-0 will be the mean of all the rows in each column, and a mean on axis-1 will be a mean of all the columns in each row.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Also explaining more, by definition, the axis number of the dimension is the index of that dimension within the array’s `shape`. It is also the position used to access that dimension during indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a 2D array `a` has shape (5,6), then you can access `a[0,0]` up to `a[4,5]`. Axis 0 is thus the first dimension (the \"rows\"), and axis 1 is the second dimension (the \"columns\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a quick example, knowing that in Numpy **dimensions are called axes**. The number of axes is rank. So lets calculate dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as npx = 10print('Dimension of x is ', np.ndim(x))# Dimension of x is  0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = [10]print('Dimension of x is ', np.ndim(x))# Dimension of x is  1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then add more elements to the array\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = [10, 20, 30 ]print('Dimension of x is ', np.ndim(x))# Dimension of x is  1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimension is still 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = [[10, 20, 30 ],     [40, 50, 60 ],     [70, 80, 90 ]    ]print('Dimension of x is ', np.ndim(x))# Dimension of x is  2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now its 2. This is a 2-D array with 3 rows and 3 columns. It has two axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In numpy arrays, dimensionality refers to the number of axes needed to index it, not the dimensionality of any geometrical space. For example, you can describe the locations of points in 3D space with a 2D array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "array([[0, 0, 0],       [1, 2, 3],       [2, 2, 2],       [9, 9, 9]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which has shape of (4, 3) and dimension 2. But it can describe 3D space because the length of each row (axis 1) is three, so each row can be the x, y, and z component of a point’s location.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you do `.sum(axis=n)`, for example, then dimension `n` is collapsed and deleted, with each value in the new matrix equal to the sum of the corresponding collapsed values.
