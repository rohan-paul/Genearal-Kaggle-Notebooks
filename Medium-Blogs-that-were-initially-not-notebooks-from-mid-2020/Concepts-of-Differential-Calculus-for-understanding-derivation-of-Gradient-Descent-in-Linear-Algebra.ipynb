    "### What Derivative of a function really is\n",
    "\n",
    "> The most fundamental defination of **Derivative** can be stated as — derivative measures the steepness of the graph of a function at some particular point on the graph. Thus, the derivative of a function is a slope at a particular point. Strictly speaking, curves don’t have slope, so we use the slope of the tangent line at a particular point on the curve. That also means that it is a ratio of change in the value of the function (dependent variable) to the change in the independent variable.\n",

    "Take a note in the above image, when Δx approaches 0, the secant line become Tangent at x0 and derivative of the function representing the above graph gives the slope of the tangent line at x0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define the derivative of the function f(x) at the point x0, as the limit of the the slope as Δx approaches zero:\n",

    "One of the essential idea in differential calculus is about approximating non-linear objects by linear ones. And we already saw, that a tangent line at a point is the best linear approximation to the curve near that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now quickly visualize the above concept — We will see later that by the rules of Differential Calculus (Power Rule) **“The derivative of x² is 2x” which** means **“At every point, we are changing by a speed of 2x** (twice the current x-position)”.\n",
    "\n",
    "And below is the graph of a function f(x) = x². As you can see just looking at the graph y is changing at double the rate of x. Which is what derivative measures.\n",

    "**Derivative can also be intutively understood as representing rate of change.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the most simplest real world example of Velocity, which is defined as the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. And Displacement here is a function of _time and_ the dependent variable and the independent variable is “time”. Now t_he_ function has been plotted on a graph. And now we’ll see that the concept of velocity and slope of a curve are connected by the same mathematical definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Velocity is the change in displacement, and so we can think of the ratio as a rate of change of displacement with the rate of change of time to be the derivative of the time function and is called the Velocity.\n",

    "A derivative of a function is a representation of the rate of change of one variable in relation to another at a given point on a function. The slope describes the steepness of a line as a relationship between the change in y-values for a change in the x-values. However note, afunction does not have a general slope. **We cannot have a slope of** y = x² **at** x = 2**, instead what we can have is the slope of the line tangent to this point.**\n",

    "The function f′(_x_) is called the derivative of f, since it is derived from f by the limiting operation. You can think of f′(_x_) as a **“slope-producing function”** in the sense that the value of f′(_x_) at x = x0 is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at x = x0 .\n",

    "And we know that in calculus, a univariate optimization involves taking the derivative and setting equal to 0. So, this minimization problem above is solved by setting the partial derivatives equal to 0. That is, take the derivative of the above equation with respect to β 0 and set it equal to 0. We then do the same thing for β 1. This gives us,\n",
