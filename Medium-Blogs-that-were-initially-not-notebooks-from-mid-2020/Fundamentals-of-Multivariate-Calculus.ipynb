    "\n",
    "To start with, as soon as you need to implement multi-variate Linear Regression, you hit multivariate-calculus which is what you will have to use to derive the Gradient of a set of multi-variate Linear Equations i.e. Derivative of a Matrix. Beyond Optimization of Neural networks (NN) cost function and variations of gradient descent algorithm here in NN and a plethora of other optimization are handled with multivariate calculus.\n",

    "Let’s consider an ML problem in which we have to predict the House Price using the following independent variables-\n",

    "*   Total Carpet-Area\n",
    "*   Number of Floors\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, each independent variable can be represented as a vector with respect to the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like,\n",
    "\n",
    "“**Total Carpet-Area**” vector will have a magnitude and positive direction with respect to House Price (House Price will increase if carpet-area also increases and House Price will decrease if carpet-area decreases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, “**Number of Floors”** will have a magnitude and positive direction with respect to House Price\n",
    "\n",
    "However “**Distance From Nearest Airport**” vector will have a magnitude and negative direction with respect to House Price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we have a new House data for which we need to predict the Price, then we can represent its data in these 3 vectors, and the point in which the 3 vectors having an orthogonal relationship can be considered as his/her predicted mark in the final examination.\n",

And by the GD-algorithm, if we are at a particular value of θ (representing coefficients of the Linear Regression function) and if we want to move to a new value of θ such that the new loss is less than the current loss then we should move in the direction opposite to the gradient.\n",

    "## Difference between a Gradient and a Derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "By now we have seen, the gradient **holds all the partial derivatives** of a multivariable function. Before we dive deep into Gradient-Descent algorithm below, let’s explore the difference between Derivative and Gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The derivative is a **number**, which shows the rate of change when some point in our function _moves_ in a particular direction. We can _visualize the derivative as a slope_ of a function which _goes along some direction on a graph_. We use the letter **d** to denote the derivative.\n",
    "2.  The gradient is, on the other hand, a **vector** which _points_ in the direction of the **steepest ascent or** the greatest upward slope whose length is the directional derivative in that direction\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the symbol ∇ to denote the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So why Gradient is a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular derivative gives us the rate of change of a single variable. For example, df/dx tells us how much the function f(x) changes for a change in x. But if a function takes multiple variables, such as x and y, it will have multiple derivatives: the value of the function will change when we change x (df/dx) and also when we change y (df/dy).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we can represent these multiple rates of change in a vector, with one component for each derivative. Thus, a function that takes 3 variables will have a gradient with 3 components each represented by a partial derivative. And just like the regular derivative, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest increase. However, now that we have multiple directions to consider (x, y, and z), the direction of greatest increase is no longer simply “forward” or “backward” along the x-axis, like it is with functions of a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two variables, then our 2-component gradient can specify any direction on a plane. Likewise, with 3 variables, the gradient can specify and direction in 3D space to move to increase our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it will make sense of the **below definition of Gradient**. The gradient of vector-valued function\n",
