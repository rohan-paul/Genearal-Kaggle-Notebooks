But, the approximation becomes better and better as the interval Ix shrinks around the point x, as P will be come closer and closer to a constant inside that small interval. The probability P ( X ∈ Ix ) approaches zero as Ix shrinks down to an infinitesemally small value to the point x (consistent with our above result for single numbers), but the information about X is contained in the rate that this probability goes to zero as Ix shrinks.\n",
