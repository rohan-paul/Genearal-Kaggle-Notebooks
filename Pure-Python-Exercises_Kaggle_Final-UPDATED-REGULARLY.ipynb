    "### Explanations and Notes on Log Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic Loss (i.e. Log Loss and also same as Cross Entropy Loss), is a classification loss function. Log Loss quantifies the accuracy of a classifier by penalising false classifications. Minimising the Log Loss is basically equivalent to maximising the accuracy of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log loss is used when we have {0,1} response. In these cases, the best models give us values in terms of probabilities. The log loss function is simply the objective function to minimize, in order to fit a log linear probability model to a set of binary labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/IVGQ307.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In slightly different form Log is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/DmdC21x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Loss is a slight modification on the Likelihood Function. In fact, Log Loss is -1 * the log of the likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Loss measures the accuracy of a classifier. It is used when the model outputs a probability for each class, rather than just the most likely class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, log loss measures the UNCERTAINTY of the probabilities of your model by comparing them to the true labels. Let us look closely at its formula and see how it measures the UNCERTAINTY.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the question is, your training labels are 0 and 1 but your training predictions are 0.4, 0.6, 0.89, 0.1122 etc.. So how do we calculate a measure of the error of our model ? If we directly classify all the observations having values > 0.5 into 1 then we are at a high risk of increasing the miss-classification. This is because it may so happen that many values having probabilities 0.4, 0.45, 0.49 can have a true value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is where logLoss comes into picture.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Log-loss is a “soft” measurement of accuracy that incorporates the idea of probabilistic confidence. It is intimately tied to information theory: log-loss is the cross entropy between the distribution of the true labels and the predictions. Intuitively speaking, entropy measures the unpredictability of something. Cross entropy incorporate the entropy of the true distribution, plus the extra unpredictability when one assumes a different distribution than the true distribution. So log-loss is an information-theoretic measure to gauge the “extra noise” that comes from using a predictor as opposed to the true labels. By minimizing the cross entropy, one maximizes the accuracy of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cases where Log-Loss function can be mostly used\n",
    "\n",
    "The log loss function is used as evaluation metric of the ML classifier models. This is an important metric as it is only metric which uses the actual predicted probability for evaluating the model ( ROC - AUC uses the order of the values but not the actual values). This is very useful as this penalizes the model heavily if it is very confident in predicting the wrong class(please check the plot of -log(x)). We optimize our model to minimize the log loss. Hence this metric is very useful in the cases where the cost of predicting wrong class is very high. Hence model tries to reduce the probabilities of belonging to wrong class and we can choose the higher threshold of probability to predict the class label. This metric can be used for both binary and multi class classifications. The value of log loss lies between 0 ( including) and infinity. This is the only disadvantage of log loss as it is not very interpretable. We know that the best case would be 0 value of log loss however we can not interpret other values of log loss. For some cases log loss of 1 can be good while for other it may not be good enough. One hack is that we can measure the log loss of random model and try to reduce log-loss of our actual model from this value as much as possible without increasing variance much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this metric can only be used if our model can predict the probability of each class. Hence for calculating the log loss for the models which don't provide the probability score, probability calibration methods can be used on top of the base classifier to predict the probability score for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An use-case of Logloss\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, I am predicting Cancer from my ML Model. And Suppose you have 5 cases. 2 cases were cancer (y1 = y2 = 1) and 3 cases were benign (y3 = y4 = y5 = 0). Say your model predicted each model has 0.5 probability of cancer. In this case, what we have for log loss is…\n",
    "\n",
    "−1/5∗(log(0.5)+log(0.5)+(1−0)∗log(1−0.5)+(1−0)∗log(1−0.5)+(1−0)∗log(1−0.5))\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, y_i and (1 - y_i) determines which term is to be dropped depending on the ground truth label. Depending on ground truth, either the log (y_hat) or log(1-y_hat) will be selected to determines how far away from truth your model’s generated probability is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the log_loss function from scikit-learn, with documentation found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html): But here we will implement a pure-python version"

You may have experienced this after a very wet night on a pub: you step forward and backward in a random fashion.  What may come as a surprise is the following fact: even when there is equal probability of going forward and backward, one can prove mathematically that the drunkard will always reach his home. Or more precisely, he will get home in finite time\n",
