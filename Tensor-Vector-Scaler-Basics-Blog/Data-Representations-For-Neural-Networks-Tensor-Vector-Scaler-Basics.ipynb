    "At its core, a tensor is a container for data—almost always numerical data. So, it’s a container for numbers. You may be already familiar with matrices, which are 2D tensors: tensors are a generalization of matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions\n",

    "A tensor that contains only one number is called a scalar (or scalar tensor, or 0-dimensional tensor, or 0D tensor). In Numpy, a float32 or float64 number is a scalar tensor (or scalar array). You can display the number of axes of a Numpy tensor via the ndim attribute; a scalar tensor has 0 axes (ndim == 0 ). The number of axes of a tensor is also called its rank. Here’s a Numpy scalar:\n"
