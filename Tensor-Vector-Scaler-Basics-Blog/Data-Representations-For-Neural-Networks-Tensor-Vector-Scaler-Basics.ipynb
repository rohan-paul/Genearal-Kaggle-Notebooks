    "In general, the first axis (axis 0, because indexing starts at 0) in all data tensors you’ll come across in deep learning will be the samples axis (sometimes called the samples dimension). In the MNIST example, samples are images of digits. In addition, deep-learning models don’t process an entire dataset at once; rather, they break the data into small batches. Concretely, here’s one batch of our MNIST digits, with batch size of 128:\n",

    "`batch = X_train_images[:128]`\n",

    "## Timeseries data or sequence data\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever time matters in your data (or the notion of sequence order), it makes sense to store it in a 3D tensor with an explicit time axis. Each sample can be encoded as a sequence of vectors (a 2D tensor), and thus a batch of data will be encoded as a 3D tensor\n",

    "- **A dataset of stock prices**. Every minute, we store the current price of the stock, the highest price in the past minute, and the lowest price in the past minute. Thus every minute is encoded as a 3D vector, an entire day of tradingencoded as a 2D tensor of shape (390, 3) (there are 390 minutes in a trading day), and 250 days’ worth of data can be stored in a 3D tensor of shape (250, 390, 3). Here, each sample would be one day’s worth of data.\n",

    "- **A dataset of tweets**, where we encode each tweet as a sequence of 280 characters out of an alphabet of 128 unique characters. In this setting, each character can be encoded as a binary vector of size 128 (an all-zeros vector except for a 1 entry at the index corresponding to the character). Then each tweet can be encoded as a 2D tensor of shape (280, 128), and a dataset of 1 million tweets can be stored in a tensor of shape (1000000, 280, 128).\n",
